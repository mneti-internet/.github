## 🏢 About Us

Mneti is a Kenyan startup/ISP rewriting the rules for internet access.

We're solving one of Kenya’s most pressing digital challenges: making internet access more **affordable**, **flexible**, and **reliable** for all — especially students, low-income families, and communities left behind by traditional ISPs.

We’re building the next generation of user-first connectivity — from Wi-Fi in city streets to smart home networks to event-based internet access — all powered by modern tech, community focus, and purpose-driven innovation.
